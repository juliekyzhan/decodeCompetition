# Data Folder

This folder contains all data used in the project. The structure is organized as follows:

- `LightGBM_raw/`: Input data for the LightGBM analysis workflow
- `analysis_raw/`: Raw data for data mining and robustness analyses
- `analysis_processed/`: Cleaned and processed data ready for descriptive analysis

**Note:** All data are fully reproducible with the scripts in the `code/` folder.
