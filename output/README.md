# Output Folder

This folder contains all outputs generated by the analysis scripts. The structure is organized as follows:

- `LightGBM_output_1022/`: Figures, tables, and model objects from the LightGBM analysis. Some of these outputs are also used as input for data mining analyses.
- `descriptive_analysis_output/`: Figures, tables, and model objects from the descriptive analysis of legislative behavior, emphasizing party influence.
- `data_mining_output/`: Figures, tables, and model objects resulting from data mining on the LightGBM outputs.
- `robust_output/`: Figures, tables, and model objects from robustness checks using raw data.

**Note:** All outputs are fully reproducible using the scripts in the `code/` folder with the data in the `data/` folder.
